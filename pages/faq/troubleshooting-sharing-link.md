# Troubleshooting Sharing Link

If you can't get a sharing link (e.g., nothing happens when trying to generate the link), it might be a temporary issue on iCloud. Please try again later. Usually, it takes a few hours to be able to generate the link.

When you share the link with others, we suggest that:

- Use Messages app from Apple so that opening the link will take you to the Expenses app automatically
- Make sure the link hasn't expired (it'll expire after 30 days)
- Make sure you both already purchased "Expenses Pro"
