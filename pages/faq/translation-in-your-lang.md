# Translation in your language

If you'd like to help us translate the app into a language that we still don't support, we really appreciate your help. In fact, we have supported many languages from our users' efforts. If you're thinking about that, feel free to [contact us](/contact/).

Here is the overall process.

1. Check all localization files (`Localizable.strings`, `Localizable.stringsdict`, and `metadata`) in English to see if it’s feasible
  > To edit those files, please use [Xcode.app](https://apps.apple.com/jp/app/xcode/id497799835?mt=12) as possible
2. Translate the files into a new language
  > You don't need to keep English sentences
3. Send back the files to me
  > Please let me know if you don't want me to add Special thanks with your name in `Settings` → `About`
4. We’ll invite you to the internal TestFlight beta so that you can check it before the official release
  > To send the beta, please let me know your AppleID (email).
5. Once everything is ok, we release a new version that has the new language support.
