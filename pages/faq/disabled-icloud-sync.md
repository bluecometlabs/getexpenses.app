<h1>Disabled iCloud Sync</h1>
<p>Expenses app relies on iCloud to sync data. If the iCloud Sync option in Settings>Sync is disabled in the app, it means the app can't access iCloud on your device. To enable it, please check the following.</p>

<p>On iOS,</p>
<ol>
    <li>Go to Settings>Apple ID>iCloud</li>
    <li>Check the checkbox for Expenses app</li>
    <li>Relaunch the app to properly reflect the change</li>
    <li>See the iCloud Sync is now enabled</li>
</ol>

<p>On macOS,</p>
<ol>
    <li>Go to System Preferences>Apple ID>iCloud Drive(Options...)</li>
    <li>Check the checkbox for Expenses.app in Documents</li>
    <li>Relaunch the app to properly reflect the change</li>
    <li>See the iCloud Sync is now enabled</li>
</ol>

<p>If it still doesn't work, please check your account in case an error occurred when getting the account status. Also, Parental Controls / Device Management might deny access to iCloud account credentials so please check those settings just in case.</p>
