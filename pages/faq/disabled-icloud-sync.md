<h1>Disabled iCloud Sync</h1>
<p>Expenses app relies on iCloud to sync data. If the iCloud Sync option is disabled in the app, it means the app can't access iCloud on your device for some reason. To enable it, please check the following.</p>

<p>iOS:</p>
<ol>
    <li>Go to "Settings (System)>Apple ID>iCloud" and make sure that you check "Expenses"</li>
    <li>Relaunch the app to properly reflect the change</li>
    <li>See the iCloud Sync is now enabled</li>
</ol>

<p>macOS:</p>
<ol>
    <li>Go to "System Preferences>Apple ID>iCloud Drive (Documents)" and make sure that you check "Expenses"</li>
    <li>Relaunch the app to properly reflect the change</li>
    <li>See the iCloud Sync is now enabled</li>
</ol>

<p>If it still doesn't work, please check your account in case an error occurred when getting the account status. Also, Parental Controls / Device Management might deny access to iCloud account credentials so please check those settings just in case.</p>
