# Weekly Stats

Weekly Stats is one of the features in Stats that shows your weekly stats at a glance. It shows your weekly expenses, 
income, and balance based on the [ISO Week Date Calendar](https://myweb.ecu.edu/mccartyr/aboutwdc.htm). Note that all 52 or 53 weeks of the year receive a number, with days of the week numbered 1 through 7, beginning with Monday.

You can also see how it works in the [example](https://myweb.ecu.edu/mccartyr/isowdcal.html).
