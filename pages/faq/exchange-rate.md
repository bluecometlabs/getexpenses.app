# Exchange Rate

There are three ways to set the exchange rate in the app:

- Default (fixed): The app uses the current exchange rate at the time of the transaction. The exchange rate is fixed.
- Custom (fixed): The app uses the exchange rate you set manually. The exchange rate is fixed.
- Auto-refresh: The app uses the latest exchange rate, which is updated daily. The exchange rate may change every day.

When you add a new transaction with a different currency in a sheet, the most recently used exchange rate option for each currency is used by default. If there is no last selected exchange rate option for the currency, the app uses "Default (fixed)".

For example, if you used "Custom (fixed)" for USD in the last transaction, the app will use "Custom (fixed)" for USD in the next transaction.
