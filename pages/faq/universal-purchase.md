<h1>Universal Purchase</h1>
<p>Our In-App purchase to unlock the full features is a universal purchase, meaning that you don't need to purchase it again in another platform as long as you use the same iCloud account. To restore a purchase you did in another platform, please check the following.</p>

<p>iOS:</p>
<ol>
    <li>Go to "Settings>Unlock the App" on Expenses</li>
    <li>Tap "Restore Purchase"</li>
    <li>Confirm that you see "Restore Purchase was successful" message</li>
</ol>

<p>macOS:</p>
<ol>
    <li>Go to "Preference...>Unlock the App" on Expenses</li>
    <li>Tap "Restore Purchase"</li>
    <li>Confirm that you see "Restore Purchase was successful" message</li>
</ol>
