## Troubleshooting Sharing Link

If you can't get a sharing link (e.g., nothing happens when trying to generate the link) when you try to share the link with others, please check the following:

- Turn on iCloud Drive (See also [Enable iCloud Sync](/faq/enable-icloud-sync))
- Make sure everyone has enough iCloud storage ([ Manage your iCloud storage](https://support.apple.com/en-us/108922){:target="_blank"})
- Make sure the email you're trying to invite is the email of their iCloud account
- Make sure you both already purchased "Expenses Pro"
- Update the latest version of iOS/iPadOS/macOS ([ Update your iPhone or iPad](https://support.apple.com/en-us/118575){:target="_blank"} / [ Update macOS on Mac](https://support.apple.com/en-us/108382){:target="_blank"})
- Use Messages app from Apple so that opening the link will take you to the Expenses app automatically

Notes for macOS users:
- On macOS 14.5 or later, there is a known issue that the link is not shown properly when using Messages app. Please use other options (e.g., Mail app) instead or do so on iOS/iPadOS
- On macOS 14.5 or later, there is a known issue that tapping Invite with Link crashes the app. Please use other options (e.g., Mail app) instead or do so from iOS/iPadOS

    <table>
        <tr>
            <td>iOS</td>
            <td>macOS</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td style="vertical-align:top"><img src="../../assets/faq/troubleshooting-sharing-link/sharing-link-messages-ios.jpg" width="80%"></td>
            <td style="vertical-align:top"><img src="../../assets/faq/troubleshooting-sharing-link/sharing-link-messages-mac.jpg"></td>
        </tr>
    </table>

It might be a temporary issue on iCloud. Please try again later (Usually, it takes a few hours to be able to generate the link). Also, note that the link will expire after 30 days.
