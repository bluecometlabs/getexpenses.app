# Repeat

You can set repeat for expense/income. The repeat can be set to the following:

- Daily
- Weekly
- Biweekly
- Monthly
- Bimonthly
- Every 3 Months
- Every 6 Months
- Yearly
- Biyearly
- Custom

You can also select the detail if you set the repeat to Custom. For example, you can set the repeat to every three months on the 15th and 25th.

Note: The repeat will be skipped if there is no day in the month. For example, if you set the repeat to every month on the 31st, the repeat will be skipped when there is no 31st in the month (e.g., April). In this case, you can use the Last Day option.
