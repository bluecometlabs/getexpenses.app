# Troubleshooting iCloud Sync

First, please make sure that you use the same iCloud account on both iOS/iPadOS and macOS, and have enough iCloud storage on both. If it still doesn't work, please do the following troubleshooting.

**iOS/iPadOS**

1. Go to `Settings (Expenses)` → `Sync`
2. Click `Force push all data to iCloud`
3. Click `Fetch all data from iCloud`
4. Check if the data is synced

**macOS**

1. Go to `Preferences... (Expenses)` → `Sync`
2. Click `Force push all data to iCloud`
3. Click `Fetch all data from iCloud`
4. Check if the data is synced

Sometimes, there is something wrong with the Apple System. Please also check [the status page](https://www.apple.com/support/systemstatus/) just in case.
