## Getting Started

When you first launch Expenses, the first thing you need to do is add a sheet. Think of it as a spreadsheet (E.g., Google Sheets) with a title. Even though how to manage sheets is up to you, we recommend you add a sheet for **a single purpose**.

Rather than adding a new sheet each month, you could add a single sheet and stick to it. Even if you have many items in a single sheet, that's fine because we provide flexible ways to see them via Stats.

For example, you could have sheets like this:

- Sheet 1: Day-to-day family spending (shared with family members)
- Sheet 2: Trip to Paris
- Sheet 3: Personal spending
- Sheet 4: Side project (shared with a friend)
