## Sensitive Mode

Sensitive Mode allows you to hide all sensitive data, such as prices, in the app.

This Mode is useful for users who want to use the app without seeing sensitive data or for users who want to share their screen without revealing sensitive information.

To enable Sensitive Mode, go to the app settings and toggle the "Sensitive Mode" option. Once enabled, all sensitive data will be hidden in the app.
