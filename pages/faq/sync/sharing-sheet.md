## Sharing Sheet

To share a sheet with others, people you added also need to purchase "Expenses Pro" because our sharing feature relies on iCloud Sync.

---

If you're having trouble with iCloud sharing in the Expenses app, please follow these steps to ensure everything is set up correctly:

Before Inviting Others:

- Use the **Messages app** (Apple) to send the invitation link — this ensures the link opens directly in the Expenses app.
- **Turn on iCloud Drive**  
  → See: [Enable iCloud Sync](/faq/enable-icloud-sync)
- Ensure all participants have **sufficient iCloud storage**  
  → [ Manage your iCloud storage](https://support.apple.com/en-us/108922){:target="_blank"}
- Confirm the email you're inviting is **linked to the recipient's iCloud account**.
- Make sure **both you and the invitee have purchased Expenses Pro**.
- Update to the **latest version of Expenses**.
- Update your device to the **latest version of iOS, iPadOS, or macOS**:  
  → [ Update iPhone or iPad](https://support.apple.com/en-us/118575){:target="_blank"} / [ Update macOS](https://support.apple.com/en-us/108382){:target="_blank"}

Troubleshooting Sync Issues:

- Check current **iCloud server status**:  
  → [ System Status](https://www.apple.com/support/systemstatus/)
- **Restart your devices** to refresh the iCloud service:  
  → [ Restart instructions](https://support.apple.com/en-us/101603)
- Try **logging out of iCloud**, then log back in.
- Temporarily **turn off iCloud Private Relay**.
- Go to `Settings > General > Background App Refresh` and **temporarily disable** it for "Expenses".
- If you or your organization uses content blockers or network security tools (e.g., **AdGuard**, **Eero Secure**, **Netskope**), ensure Expenses is **exempted**.

Still Not Syncing?:

- Check if the syncing issue occurs with **other apps** as well.
- If multiple apps are affected, it's likely a broader iCloud issue — please contact **Apple Support**.

Notes for macOS Users:

> ⚠️ On **macOS 14.5 or later**, there are known issues:  
> 
> - **iCloud invite links may not appear correctly** when using the Messages app. Try using Mail or another app instead — or send from an iOS/iPadOS device.  
> - **Tapping “Invite with Link” may crash the app.** Please use another method (like Mail), or initiate the invite from an iOS/iPadOS device.
