## Sharing Sheet

To share a sheet with others, people you added also need to purchase "Expenses Pro" because our sharing feature relies on iCloud Sync.

### Troubleshooting Sharing Link

If you can't get a sharing link (e.g., nothing happens when trying to generate the link) when you try to share the link with others, please check the following:

- Use Messages app from Apple so that opening the link will take you to the Expenses app automatically.
- Turn on iCloud Drive (See also [Enable iCloud Sync](/faq/enable-icloud-sync)).
- Make sure everyone has enough iCloud storage ([ Manage your iCloud storage](https://support.apple.com/en-us/108922){:target="_blank"})
- Make sure the email you're trying to invite is the email of their iCloud account.
- Make sure you both already purchased "Expenses Pro".
- Update to the latest version of Expenses.
- Update the latest version of iOS/iPadOS/macOS ([ Update your iPhone or iPad](https://support.apple.com/en-us/118575){:target="_blank"} / [ Update macOS on Mac](https://support.apple.com/en-us/108382){:target="_blank"}).
- Check [ iCloud server reliability](https://www.apple.com/support/systemstatus/).
- [ Restart your devices](https://support.apple.com/en-us/101603) to restart the iCloud service.
- Log out of your iCloud account and log back in.
- Turn off iCloud Private Relay.
- Go to your device `Settings > General > Background App Refresh` and disable it temporarily for "Expenses" on the list.
- Exempt Expenses from content-blocking or network-security apps, e.g. AdGuard, Eero Secure, Netskope, if you or your company happens to be using them.
- Check if Expenses is the only app with syncing issues. If multiple apps have this issue, please contact Apple Support.

Notes for macOS users:

> - On macOS 14.5 or later, there is a known issue that the link is not shown properly when using Messages app. Please use other options (e.g., Mail app) instead or do so on iOS/iPadOS
> - On macOS 14.5 or later, there is a known issue that tapping Invite with Link crashes the app. Please use other options (e.g., Mail app) instead or do so from iOS/iPadOS
