## Upgrade from Subscription to Lifetime

If you have a current monthly or yearly subscription, you will need to disable the auto-renewal of your current subscription and allow it to expire. Once expired you will then be able to purchase a Lifetime option.

For instructions on how to disable auto-renewal Please see [ï£¿ If you want to cancel a subscription from Apple](https://support.apple.com/en-us/118428).

Purchasing a Lifetime option will not cancel the auto-renewal of a current subscription and so we advise you to ensure the above steps are completed to avoid additional overlapping charges.

Please note that the cost of a previous subscription cannot be credited towards the cost of a Lifetime option upgrade.
