# Troubleshooting error when restoring purchase

Please check the following list. If restoring purchase didn't work , and you use the same iCloud account, please try to purchase it again to make the restore work. You're not charged twice if you use the same iCloud account (In case it happens, you can always request a refund. See [Request a refund](https://getexpenses.app/faq/request-refund)).
 
- Make sure that you're signed in with the same Apple ID you used to make the purchase
- Check [Prevent in-app purchases from the App Store](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204396) from Apple Support on your device to make sure in-app purchases are allowed
- Restart your device
- Make sure your payment information for the App Store is up to date and try restoring again
