# Data migration issues on v3.2.3

We've found data migration issues after updating the app to v3.2.3 from earlier versions. We're sorry for the inconvenience.

Since the potential cause was pretty complicated from a technical perspective, we couldn't find a way to fix it reliably in the upcoming versions. We'll rollback all the features introduced in v3.2.3 (and v3.2.4) and disable these versions on App Store later on.

Please check the following steps to see if you can restore your data:

- Update the app to v3.2.5 or higher versions
- Force-fetching all data from iCloud. See also [Troubleshooting iCloud Sync](/faq/troubleshooting-icloud-sync)

If you haven't enabled iCloud Sync, please contact us via email. We'll do our best to find a way to restore your data.
