<p>To share a sheet with others, people you added also need to unlock the full features because our Sharing uses iCloud sync. If the people still can't see anything you shared, please check the following on both sides (you and people you added).</p>

    <li>You have enough storage space in iCloud on your device</li>
    <li>Go to "Settings (System)>Apple ID>iCloud" and make sure that you check "Expenses"</li>
    <li>Go to "Settings>Sync" on Expenses and check iCloud Sync is turned on</li>
    <li>Try force push all data to iCloud in Sync, and then try force fetch all data from iCloud</li>
</ul>

<p>macOS:</p>
<ul>
    <li>You have enough storage space in iCloud</li>
    <li>Go to "System Preferences>Apple ID>iCloud Drive (Documents)" and make sure that you check "Expenses"</li>
