<ul>
    <li>On your device, you have enough storage space in iCloud</li>
    <li>On your device, go to "Settings>Apple ID>iCloud" and make sure that you check "Expenses"</li>
    <li>On Expenses, go to "Settings>Sync" and check iCloud Sync is turned on</li>
    <li>On Expenses, try force push all data to iCloud in Sync, and then try force fetch all data from iCloud</li>
</ul>

<ul>
    <li>On your laptop, you have enough storage space in iCloud</li>
    <li>On your laptop, go to "System Preferences>Apple ID>iCloud Drive (Documents)" and make sure that you check "Expenses"</li>
