# Sharing a sheet with others

To share a sheet with others, people you added also need to purchase "Expenses Pro" because our sharing feature uses iCloud Sync. If the people still can't see anything you shared, please check the following on both sides (you and people you added).

- [iOS/iPadOS](#iosipados)
- [macOS](#macos)
- [Troubleshooting](#troubleshooting)

## iOS/iPadOS

- Make sure that you enable iCloud Sync (See also [Enabling iCloud Sync](/faq/enabling-icloud-sync))

## Troubleshooting

Sharing a sheet with others uses iCloud Sharing just like sharing a note in Notes.app. If you have any trouble with iCloud Sharing, please check the following:

- Make sure that you and the person you're trying to share or collaborate with have the latest version of iOS, iPadOS, or macOS
- Sign in to iCloud with the same Apple ID on all your devices
- Make sure everyone has enough storage

Also, please check if iCloud Sharing works for other apps, such as Notes.app. If it's not working as expected, you may have to contact Apple Support to solve iCloud issues. Based on our experience, iCloud Sharing can be broken sometimes if you have any issues on your iCloud account.
